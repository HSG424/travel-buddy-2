# Travel Buddy 2

[Travel Buddy 2](https://travel-buddy-reloaded.web.app) provides tools to users that are traveling to foreign countries.

Current weather conditions ([AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/apis)) are displayed after detecting the user's latitude and longitude via the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API). There is also a language translation tool users can use which consumes API endpoints provided by [MyMemory](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php) (language translation).

[Travel Buddy 2](https://travel-buddy-reloaded.web.app) uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) while the original [Travel Buddy](https://github.com/HSG424/travel-buddy) uses Vanilla JavaScript.

Live deployment (Firebase): [https://travel-buddy-reloaded.web.app](https://travel-buddy-reloaded.web.app)

## Reflection

The original [Travel Buddy](https://github.com/HSG424/travel-buddy) web app was developed using Vanilla Javascript.

In order to practice key concepts I learned in [Udemyâ€™s top React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), I chose to redo the Travel Buddy project using React.

This was not my first time using a front-end library/framework.

My last job primarily involved using Vue.js so the React development and build process was nothing new or difficult.
